"Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo" is a grammatically correct sentence in English,
often presented as an example of how homonyms and homophones can be used
to create complicated linguistic constructs through lexical ambiguity.
It has been discussed in literature in various forms since 1967, when it appeared
in Dmitri Borgmann's Beyond Language: Adventures in Word and Thought.

The sentence employs three distinct meanings of the word buffalo:

    as an adjectival proper noun to refer to a specific place named Buffalo, the city of Buffalo, New York, being the most notable;
    as a verb to buffalo, meaning (in American English) "to bully, harass, or intimidate" or "to baffle"; and
    as a noun to refer to the animal, bison (often called buffalo in North America). The plural is also buffalo.

A semantically equivalent form preserving the original word order is:
"Buffalo bison that other Buffalo bison bully also bully Buffalo bison."
